In the TextClient.java, I add a while loop to keep communicate with server and client and not disconnect the connection.
In the TextServer.java, After the server receive the message from client, it will ask the user to communicate to the client. 
So, I added a scanner to read from the user and modify the code so that it will send what user input.
